CLORANCE: What’s… this?
CLORANCE: Looks like a teddy bear. Or something that used to be a teddy bear.
BALLY-WALLY: Wait, wait! Don’t touch that…
CLORANCE: Oh, okay-
BALLY-WALLY: Don’t just throw it back where you found it.
CLORANCE: What should I do with it then?
BALLY-WALLY: Well, if you hold onto it for now, I can always… teach you something new in exchange for these items?
CLORANCE: A potion upgrade? Like what you already taught me… but even better?
CLORANCE: You really are the best, Bally-Wally!
BALLY-WALLY: Not so fast.
BALLY-WALLY: You have to keep it safe, alright? As safe as possible.
CLORANCE: Is there a reason that I should?
BALLY-WALLY: I don’t know, they’re… nice, yeah, that’s it. Just keep it safe for me and don’t let it get any more damaged than it is… please.
CLORANCE: Of course I’ll keep it safe for you! You’re one of my best friends.
BALLY-WALLY: I’m sure there’s more… more like this around the area. Just find what you can, and I’ll help you learn even more.
CLORANCE: What are these things?
BALLY-WALLY: What? Oh, they’re just… artifacts.
CLORANCE: I’ll be sure to keep an eye out for these artifacts then!
