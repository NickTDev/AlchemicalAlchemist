BALLY-WALLY: “Hm.”
CLORANCE: “Bally-Wally? Why haven’t you been talking?”
BALLY-WALLY: “There was no reason for me to talk then. Continuing on this path should guide you into the Ghastly Woods…”
CLORANCE: “Were you shy?”
BALLY-WALLY: “What! No!”
BALLY-WALLY: “Of course not!”
CLORANCE: “Aw, alright.”
BALLY-WALLY: “Let’s just keep moving, Clorance. First we get those Zorkorkle Tears from where the slug told us to get them.”
BALLY-WALLY: “There are also plenty of Ghostly Feathers in the Ghastly Woods. Just keep looking.”
