BALLY-WALLY: “Catterpurrlar are tricky little things, always attacking like they’re starved wolves.”
CLORANCE: “What is this thing they dropped?”
BALLY-WALLY: “Crimsocal Sludge”
BALLY-WALLY: “Good, good. This is very good.”
BALLY-WALLY: “Now, I’m sure you know how potions use the elements provided in different ingredients.”
CLORANCE: “Of course!”
CLORANCE: “That’s why we classify potion ingredients into different color classes at Wizarding School.”
BALLY-WALLY: “Yes, well, it’s the same principle. The only difference between the ingredients within a certain color category is their secondary element.”
BALLY-WALLY: “Some places might use numbers, or even more colors, but here in The Dying Forest, we use shapes.”
BALLY-WALLY: “And you know that if you use only one shape when it comes to brewing potions…”
CLORANCE: “It makes a varient of the potion! The cloud acts specially after the potion bursts.”
BALLY-WALLY: “Mhm. So try it out now that you have all of this Crimsocal Sludge.”
