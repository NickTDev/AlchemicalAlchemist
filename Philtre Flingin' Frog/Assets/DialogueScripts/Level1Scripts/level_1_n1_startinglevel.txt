CLORANCE: Phewww, a clearing!
CLORANCE: Glad we’re out of the woods.
BALLY-WALLY: The Ghastly Woods, haha. I get it..
CLORANCE: What?
BALLY-WALLY: ...
BALLY-WALLY: Nevermind. Take a look around.
[Pans around the sight of the level.]
CLORANCE: It’s… It’s massive!
BALLY-WALLY: The Vale of Pain isn’t too hard to navigate, luckily.
BALLY-WALLY: There’s a clearing all the way on the other side, up on a flat hill.
BALLY-WALLY: Ghost Pigeons enjoy roosting there. That’s where we’ll be able to get a Ghostly Feather.
CLORANCE: Wait, Ghost Pigeons?
BALLY-WALLY: Yes, Ghost Pigeons. Don’t try to pluck them, it never ends well. It’s likely they’ll drop some feathers on their own.
CLORANCE: I really can’t wait to see them.
CLORANCE: Maybe I’ll be able to paint one from memory for my Papa!
BALLY-WALLY: ...Right.
BALLY-WALLY: Let’s focus on what’s in front of us right now, take a look at what’s closer around us.
