BALLY-WALLY: It’s light because it’s ‘Ghostly’... You’ll get used to it.
BALLY-WALLY: Good thing we don’t have to wait for another to drop from a Ghost Pigeon…
BALLY-WALLY: Why are you looking around so much?
CLORANCE: I don’t… I don’t see the Ghost Pigeons.
BALLY-WALLY: Of course you can’t see them, they’re ghosts!
CLORANCE: Hm..
BALLY-WALLY: Don’t question it.
BALLY-WALLY: We got what we came here for.
BALLY-WALLY: The first ingredient of many, but it’s good to be making progress this fast.
CLORANCE: Tadpolli Village, here we come!
BALLY-WALLY: What?
CLORANCE: Yeah, I gotta get home for my Papa, remember?
BALLY-WALLY: Ah, right… Your Papa Frog.
BALLY-WALLY: ‘Tadpolli Village, here we come’ indeed.
CLORANCE: I hope he’s not worried sick… Seeing how he’s already sick and all.
BALLY-WALLY: I’m sure he’s fine. Now, chin up. Let’s move onto the next area.
