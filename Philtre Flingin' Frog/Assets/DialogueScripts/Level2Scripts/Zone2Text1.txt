CLORANCE: This area seems extra confusing for me. Where am I supposed to go, Bally-Wally?
BALLY-WALLY: The Grove of Tears has always been unreliable to navigate.
BALLY-WALLY: Just keep moving and trust your instincts.
CLORANCE: I don’t know about this…
BALLY-WALLY: Things will be fine, you know how to deal with any obstacles. There will be more ingredients as well.
CLORANCE: (takes a deep breath) Okay, I’m ready!
BALLY-WALLY: Stay vigilant.
CLORANCE: Will do, Bally-Wally. Thanks for the pep-talk and being here for me.
BALLY-WALLY: ...Don’t mention it.
